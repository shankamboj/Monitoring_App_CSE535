Q1: Specifications for Health-dev framework: 

1. Data collection and sensor:
a. Describe on what all sensers to use ( camera, mic, motion sensor, vibration etc )
b. Describe on how to use these sensors. Ex - Use mic for recording heart beat sound, use camera for recording the blood color

2. User screen
a. Explain on what all features should a user be seen on it's devide
b. Explain on how these features will be used, what buttons will do what kind of functioning when clicked
c. Explain on what kind of output should be shown to user after processing is done

3. Hardware to use for processing/storage:
a. Describe on what all hardware devices are available and can be used for each specific type of processing
b. Describe on what all type of storage devices are available (Hard disc, memory card etc) which can be used to store the data.

4. Data and processing flow
a. Describe on what is the expted flow. For example -> First take input, clean data, pre-process, do the expected computation and then show it to user output screen.

Q2: Using bHealthy

1. Build new app:
   a. Use data from bHealthy
    b. Combine it with data stored in database in project 1
   c. Find the regular pattern like monthly headaches, fever during specific weather time and temperature
    d. Send alerts to user to take precautions
2. Understand the regular health issues of the user. Over the time use all the data from different sources and observe user symptoms. Use this data to predict the user upcoming health issues.

Q3: Yes. My thoughts about this has changed. Before i used to think that mobile computing is only about developing mobile apps But now i have wider context around the same.

Mobile computing can include following aspects as well:

1. Surrounding awareness: System should be aware of the data around the surroundings it is present in. For example - It show know the temperature it is in, the speed at which it is moving etc
2. Cotext Understanding: the system should be aware of the context around which it is performing. For exmaple - if we are gathering the data of user health, the app should know what are we collecting and why are we collecting. using this information app should adjust it's according to the situations and perform better.
3. Hardware used: We are using local server for storing the data locally. bHealthy used Health-Dev for connecting to sensors and phons. There can be multiple options on using the hardware and cloud resoruces. We should understand the diffirent possibilities and use the one that best fits our requirements and use case.
4. Feedback and improvement: The mobile should also be able to gather feedback and enhance its behaviour to best fir the user.

In summary, Mobile computing is is not just about app development but alot more including surrounding awareness, hardware usage, context understanding, sensors, feedback and improvements etc.
